### Installation

```sh
go get github.com/wayneashleyberry/hn/cmd/hn
```

### Motivation

This is a very basic command that prints the top 3 stories from hacker news. It does use escape codes to make the links clickable, cache the results to make it fast and use some decent colours â€” but that's literally all it does.
